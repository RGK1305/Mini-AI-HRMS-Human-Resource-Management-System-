# RIZE OS — SaaS Go-To-Market Strategy

## The Problem
Companies with 50–200 employees struggle with three things:
1. **Visibility**: Managers can't objectively measure productivity across departments.
2. **Skill Gaps**: No data-driven way to identify what skills employees need to grow.
3. **Trust**: When remote, there's no verifiable proof of task completion.

## The Solution: RIZE OS
An AI-powered HRMS that gives managers **real-time workforce intelligence** and employees **blockchain-verified work records**.

## Key Differentiators
1. **AI scores are deterministic + fair** — not a black box. Managers see the exact formula. Speed is graded on whether the deadline was met, not how much slack was left — so employees are never penalised for completing a 10-day task on day 9.
2. **Trend Predictor shows trajectory, not just a snapshot** — identify a declining performer 2 months before it becomes a crisis.
3. **Blockchain proof-of-work** — employees have verifiable, tamper-proof completion records on Ethereum Sepolia, auditable by anyone via Etherscan.
4. **Skill gap detection is actionable** — the AI recommends specific skills based on the employee's actual role, not generic advice.
